Comparison of classification techniques to predict wine quality (low/high) from its characteristics to enable quick and effective quality tracking of their wines at production facilities

Classification techniques include k-Nearest-Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes’ and SVM classifiers. The data for this exercise is wine industry data. Each record represents a sample of a specific wine product, the input attributes include its organoleptic characteristics, and the output denotes the quality class of each wine: {high, low}.
